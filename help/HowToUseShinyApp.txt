Using the Shiny App

PCA on PC1 and PC2:
-You yan choose the structure referring to the Macrocycles - (cpd X -refers to names as in the puplication)
-the process determines how the conformers(-snapchots) were generated
--MD at different temperatures
--long MD longer duration
--SimAn stands for Simulating Annealing using the lowest engetic conformer(TopConf) or diverse start-conformers
--BEST, minimised Prime, minimies Conformator are tested conformer generators (output has undergo energy minimization)
--post-selected were low energy conformers which were found by MD and hat undergo MD again (MINI = energetic minimsed)
-the charge status is relevant for all but structure
-for different processes different start-conformers were given -all Processes have different 5 Start Structures, except
--SimAn_TopConf (Simulating Annealing using the lowest energetic Conformer as start-conformer)
--long MD (has 10 start-conformers, longer duration)
-different solvent data not available for all processes!
-Simulation Temperature (relevant for the hot MDs only)
-measured in (for displaying Energy)
-Sliders to cut out high energy conformers- please use slider appropiate to chosen measure (kacl or kj)
-Color Switch only for illustrative purposes
-choose in DropOut menu infomration you want to color

--If you click GO1 the first plotting space will be filled with the selected data
Note: if you want to change the Selection (even a color change) you have to click GO1 again

If the plot is drawn you might want to choose a format you want to save a specific plot to.
Note: will be saved to your current workspace(only changeable before starting the shinyApp)

The Tab Density Maps and lightPCA are two different approaches to plot the exact same information seen in the PCA
trying to overcome the issue of crowding and overplotting

The tab Loadings is the Loading information of the underlying PCA space the data generated /was projected to.

Note: all the above depend on the selected data in the tab PCA on PC1 and PC2

Energy Diagram - the underlying data is for MD at 300K only and the 3 tested conformer generators, you can choose the structure /Charge status and the Solvent
(except DMSO), the sliders can help to adjust resulting histogram. This is displaying the percentage of found confomers splitted in 4 energy bins.
for comparison.

The Tab PSA histograme (Polar Surface Area) displays available information based on data selected in tab PCA on PCA1 and PC2.
Note not for all generated conformers the PSA was determined.
