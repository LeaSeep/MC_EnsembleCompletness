Guidlines to produce paper-Figures

Figure 1: PCA Loading Plots
go to Tab Loadings and then
Figure 1a) set 'PC on x-Axis' = 1 and 'PC on y-Axis' = 2
Figure 1b) set 'PC on x-Axis' = 3 and 'PC on y-Axis' = 4
Note: inside the R consolte you get the summary of Importance of the components
(std. Dev., proportion of Variance, cumulative proportion)

Figure 2: Maps for compound 1
go to Tab PCA on PC1 and PC2
select:
Choose Structures: 5(cpd 1)
Process: MD at 300K
Start_structure: 1,2,3,4,5 (or all)
Solvent: water
Simulation Temperature: 300K
Measured in: choose preferred option
leave Ranges untouched
Color Switch for binned Energy: choose preferred option
Color by: Start_structure
Figure 2a) ChargeStatus: neutral
Figure 2b) ChargeStatus: charged
Click GO_1 ( To plot on first plotting space, top left)
Note: For each category there must be at least one option selected otherwise nothing will be plotted
Note: To save this plot choose preferred Format and AFTERWARDS choose to save plot 1, 
the plot will dissapear out of the app
